This is a Android mobile application that converts Hand Signs to Text as well as to speech.

You can login , click a picture which is then converted to it's equivalent text.
You can also click a picture and submit it to us , so we can collect images and then train and improve our model.

We have created the model using Tensorflow and Deep learning techniques.
We have used Firebase for login and authentication , Tensorflow lite to integrate our model into the android app . 
The Model was Trained on ASL dataset and Coloured image dataset.
